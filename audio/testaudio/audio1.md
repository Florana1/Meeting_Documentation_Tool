## Summary

### Meeting Overview
The team discussed an earlier proposal and agreed to proceed with it flexibly. The main topic was reviewing engineering KPIs, specifically the overlap and distinction between the "R&D overall MR rate" and "R&D wider MR rate" metrics.

### Key Points
- The team agreed to stick with an earlier proposal and remain flexible on its implementation
- Sid raised concerns about having both "R&D overall MR rate" and "R&D wider MR rate" as top-level engineering KPIs
- The wider MR rate includes both internal and external (community) merge requests, which duplicates the overall MR rate as a productivity metric
- David suggested the wider MR rate should track only external/community contributions to avoid duplication

### Action Items
- [ ] Clarify and resolve the overlap between the two MR rate KPIs

### Decisions Made
- Agreed to proceed with the earlier proposal, with flexibility to adjust (e.g., development teams may iterate more frequently)

**David** (00:00:02):
don't, I could see either way, so let's stick with the proposal.

**Sid** (00:00:07):
Cool, we'll try it and we can be flexible. I mean, the development is larger, maybe they go more frequently or something like that, but we'll see how it goes. All right, and then I've got number five, which is we've got R &D overall MR rate, and we also have R &D wider MR rate, both as top -level KPIs for engineering. So the difference between them, in the simplest sense, is that R &D wider MR rate includes both community contributions and community MRs. The problems I see with this are that, one, the wider MR rate, the one that includes internal and external MRs, it duplicates the overall MR rate, which is a productivity metric. Sorry, the

**David** (00:00:55):
wider MR rate should just be... External, right? And then...
